### Math

- Per default, back-end send us scores in decimal nor in percentage (exemple: 0.88 instead of 88). Make sure to use directly percente pipe.
- To get variation between percentages: we take only differences (exemple: 10% and 20%, the variation will be +10%).
- To get variation between numbers: We use this formula: ( A - B) / A (exemple: (20 - 10) / 10 that give us +100% of variation). **Available in score.service getProgression**
- We try to put maximum of calculations in the backend to provide any errors of "manual" calculations.
- During testing, make sure all cases are tested and sounds good.
- As much as you can, use score/stats services to help you.

### Hotfix

- Create a commit on `main` with the hotfix
- Make a 'git cherry pick' to bring the hot fix on `develop`


### Emojis

Demo page https://fluentemoji.com/

You can access all names with the `enum EmojiName`

```
Figma => fluent-emoji:waving-hand

EmojiName => EmojiName.WavingHand
```

You can use the `emoji` pipe to transform the Enum to an SVG

You then, have to set the height and width with CSS

```
  <img [src]="EmojiName.Gear | emoji" loading="lazy" />
```

### Service workers

They are used to cache some data in the browser. The config file is located at the root of the project `ngsw-config.json`.

They only work in production config.
